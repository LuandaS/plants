                <p>Beginner plants are a great way to start gardening. A plant nursery worker should have knowledge of
                    cloning and seeding. The parts of a plant are divided into two basic sections, the root and the
                    shoot. The root is comprised of all the structures below the soil, and the shoot is composed of the
                    structures above. The shoot of seed plants includes the stem, the leaves, and the seeds.
                    Additionally, angiosperms contain flowers as part of their shoots. Each of these structures is vital
                    in different ways to the plant's existence. A beginner's guide to vegetable gardening includes
                    information about planning and maintaining a home vegetable garden. The plant life cycle consists of
                    five stages, from seeds to growth to pollination!</p>

                        <p>Lighting is crucial for the growth and development of indoor plants. Plants require light to
                            convert oxygen and water into energy through photosynthesis. Different plants have different
                            light requirements, and it is important to provide them with the right amount and type of
                            light. Light also acts as an environmental signal for plants, affecting their growth rate
                            and activity.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Water is an essential nutrient for plants, comprising up to 95% of a
                                plant's tissue. It is required for seed germination and is used by plants for
                                photosynthesis, cooling, and transportation of nutrients. Overwatering can lead to root
                                decay and misdiagnosis of pest damage. Watering established trees and shrubs requires
                                absorption of water from the soil into the roots of plants, and transpiration pulls
                                streams of water molecules up into the plant through interconnected tissues within. It
                                is important to water plants at their desired hydration level to keep them strong and
                                healthy.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Plants require a variety of chemical elements to grow and thrive,
                                including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are considered primary
                                macronutrients. These nutrients are needed in larger amounts than other nutrients. Each
                                soil type has its own mix of nutritional ingredients, and not all plants can access the
                                key nutrients found in the soil or in the air. Fertilizers provide plants with the
                                necessary nutrients to grow and produce healthy fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The
                                most important components of plant fertilizer are the Big 3: nitrogen, phosphorus, and
                                potassium.</p>
